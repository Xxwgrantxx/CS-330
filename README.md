Comp Graphic and visualization
1.	How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to first visualize the final product. That step was very straightforward since I was designing an already defined image. Once that was done, I determined what I would need to get to this product by back planning. I needed to design a 3D house. This house has two floors, the top floor has a roof and one room, the bottom floor has two rooms with a roof on one side and so on until I am down to what each individual section will need. I can then begin tackling each of these sections and iterating up to completing the house.
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
I apply a similar approach to developing programs as designing software. Once I know what the big picture looks like, I can break it down into easier to work with sections. These sections are then iterated on until the program is at its completion point. Working with this 3D scene has allowed me to widen my mind to the different resources available to programmers. These resources were a big help since I was hit constantly with issues that were infuriating at times.
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The skills acquired in this course allowed me to understand graphics from multiple perspectives. I have always had the mindset that even though you don’t have to know how something works to use it, you won’t truly ever utilize something without knowing how it works. Especially when it breaks, or you are faced with unfamiliar results. By knowing how something works, you will better be able to trouble shoot issues that present themselves.
